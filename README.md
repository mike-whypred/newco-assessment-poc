## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- You have installed [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the App

To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server and provide you with a URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) where you can access the app in your web browser.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app script.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the Python dependencies.
- `data.csv`: a list of questions and scoring for the associated answers

## Usage

Modify the `app.py` file to add or customize the features of the Streamlit app. After making changes, you can view the updates by refreshing the web page.
